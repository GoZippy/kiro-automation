# Product Requirements Document: Kiro Automation Extension

## Overview

A VS Code extension that provides programmatic automation for Kiro task execution, enabling fully autonomous development workflows without manual intervention. The extension integrates with Kiro's chat interface, task management system, and file operations to create a seamless automated development experience.

## Problem Statement

Current Kiro automation requires manual intervention:
- Copy/paste prompts between terminal and chat
- Manual task completion confirmation
- No way to run tasks overnight or unattended
- Breaks the flow of autonomous development

## Solution

A VS Code extension that:
- Reads task lists from `.kiro/specs/*/tasks.md`
- Programmatically sends prompts to Kiro chat
- Monitors task completion
- Automatically continues to next tasks
- Provides progress tracking and control

## Target Users

- **Primary**: Developers using Kiro for automated task execution
- **Secondary**: Teams wanting overnight/unattended development
- **Tertiary**: DevOps engineers building CI/CD with Kiro

## Key Features

### Core Automation
- **Task Discovery**: Automatically find incomplete tasks in spec files
- **Prompt Generation**: Create contextual prompts with requirements/design
- **Chat Integration**: Send prompts to Kiro chat programmatically
- **Completion Detection**: Monitor when tasks are finished
- **Auto-Continue**: Move to next task without intervention

### User Interface
- **Task Progress Panel**: Visual progress through all specs
- **Control Panel**: Start/stop/pause automation
- **Log Viewer**: Real-time execution logs
- **Settings**: Configure automation behavior

### Advanced Features
- **Parallel Execution**: Run multiple specs simultaneously
- **Error Recovery**: Handle failures and retry logic
- **Notifications**: Desktop alerts for completion/errors
- **Reporting**: Generate progress reports and metrics

## User Stories

### Epic 1: Basic Automation
- As a developer, I want to start automation and have it run all tasks without intervention
- As a developer, I want to see progress as tasks complete
- As a developer, I want to pause/resume automation at any time

### Epic 2: Task Management
- As a developer, I want to skip specific tasks or specs
- As a developer, I want to retry failed tasks
- As a developer, I want to see detailed logs of what happened

### Epic 3: Integration
- As a developer, I want the extension to work with existing Kiro workflows
- As a developer, I want to use this with any spec-based project
- As a developer, I want to configure automation settings per project

## Technical Requirements

### VS Code Extension
- TypeScript-based extension
- Integrates with VS Code's extension API
- Provides custom views and panels
- Handles file system operations

### Kiro Integration
- Discover Kiro's internal chat API
- Send messages programmatically
- Monitor chat responses
- Detect task completion

### File Operations
- Read/write task markdown files
- Parse task status ([ ], [~], [x])
- Update task completion status
- Handle multiple spec directories

### Error Handling
- Graceful failure recovery
- Retry logic for failed operations
- User notification of issues
- Logging and debugging support

## Success Metrics

### Primary Metrics
- **Automation Success Rate**: >95% of tasks complete without intervention
- **Time Savings**: 80% reduction in manual task management
- **User Adoption**: 50+ active users within 3 months

### Secondary Metrics
- **Error Recovery**: <5% of failures require manual intervention
- **Performance**: Task execution within 10% of manual speed
- **Reliability**: 99% uptime during automation runs

## Constraints

### Technical Constraints
- Must work within VS Code extension sandbox
- Limited to Kiro's available APIs
- Cannot modify Kiro's core functionality
- Must handle Kiro updates gracefully

### Business Constraints
- Open source (MIT license)
- No external dependencies on paid services
- Must work offline
- Compatible with existing Kiro installations

## Risks and Mitigations

### High Risk: Kiro API Changes
- **Risk**: Kiro updates break the extension
- **Mitigation**: Version compatibility checks, graceful degradation

### Medium Risk: Performance Impact
- **Risk**: Extension slows down VS Code
- **Mitigation**: Efficient algorithms, background processing

### Low Risk: User Adoption
- **Risk**: Users prefer manual workflow
- **Mitigation**: Clear documentation, gradual rollout

## Timeline

### Phase 1: Research & Foundation (1-2 weeks)
- Reverse engineer Kiro's chat API
- Build basic extension scaffold
- Implement task file parsing

### Phase 2: Core Automation (2-3 weeks)
- Chat integration
- Task execution loop
- Basic UI panels

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (1-2 weeks)
- Error handling
- Progress tracking
- Settings and configuration

### Phase 4: Polish & Release (1 week)
- Testing and bug fixes
- Documentation
- Packaging and distribution

## Future Enhancements

### Version 2.0
- Multi-project support
- Team collaboration features
- Advanced scheduling
- Integration with CI/CD systems

### Version 3.0
- AI-powered task optimization
- Predictive error detection
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- Cloud synchronization

## Acceptance Criteria

The extension is considered successful when:
1. A user can click "Start Automation" and walk away
2. All tasks in a spec complete without intervention
3. The user receives a notification when done
4. Logs show exactly what happened
5. Failed tasks can be retried with one click

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies
- Kiro IDE (VS Code extension)
- Task specification format
- File system access

### External Dependencies
- VS Code Extension API
- Node.js runtime
- TypeScript compiler

## Open Questions

1. **Kiro API Discovery**: How do we programmatically send chat messages?
2. **Completion Detection**: How do we know when Kiro finishes a task?
3. **Error Handling**: What happens when Kiro encounters errors?
4. **Multi-instance**: Can we run multiple Kiro chats simultaneously?
5. **Permissions**: What VS Code permissions do we need?

## Next Steps

1. Create detailed technical specification
2. Research Kiro's internal architecture
3. Build proof-of-concept for chat integration
4. Develop task parsing and execution logic
5. Create user interface mockups
