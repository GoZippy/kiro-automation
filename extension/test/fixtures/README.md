# Test Fixtures

This directory contains test fixtures and mock data for the Kiro Automation Extension test suite.

## Structure

- `specs/` - Sample spec directories with tasks.md files
- `mocks/` - Mock implementations of Kiro interfaces
- `data/` - Test data files (JSON, markdown, etc.)

## Usage

Test fixtures are used to create consistent test environments across different test suites. They provide:

- Sample task specifications
- Mock Kiro API responses
- Test workspace structures
- Configuration examples

## Adding New Fixtures

When adding new fixtures:

1. Place them in the appropriate subdirectory
2. Document their purpose in this README
3. Keep fixtures minimal and focused
4. Use realistic data that matches production patterns
