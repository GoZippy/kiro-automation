## Known Issues and Limitations

### Documented Limitations
1. **Kiro API Integration**: Uses fallback mechanisms pending real API discovery
2. **Completion Detection**: Heuristic-based, may need tuning
3. **Performance**: Based on simulated workloads

### Mitigation Strategies
- Comprehensive error handling and retry logic
- Configurable timeouts and thresholds
- Detailed logging for troubleshooting
- User notifications for manual intervention

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk ✅
- Core functionality thoroughly tested
- Comprehensive error handling
- Extensive documentation
- Clean code quality

### Medium Risk ⚠️
- Real Kiro API integration untested
- Completion detection heuristics
- Performance with large-scale workloads

### Mitigation Plan
- Beta testing with real Kiro environments
- Gather user feedback for tuning
- Monitor telemetry for issues
- Rapid patch releases if needed
