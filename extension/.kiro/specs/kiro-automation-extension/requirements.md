# Requirements Document: Kiro Automation Extension

## Introduction

The Kiro Automation Extension is a VS Code extension that enables fully autonomous task execution within the Kiro IDE environment. It programmatically reads task specifications, sends prompts to Kiro chat, monitors completion, and continues through task lists without manual intervention. The extension bridges the gap between Kiro's powerful AI capabilities and the need for unattended, overnight development workflows.

## Glossary

- **Kiro IDE**: AI-powered development environment built on VS Code
- **Task Spec**: Markdown files containing task lists in `.kiro/specs/*/tasks.md` format
- **Automation Session**: A continuous run through one or more task specifications
- **Chat Integration**: Programmatic interface to send messages to Kiro's chat system
- **Task Status**: Completion state indicated by `[ ]` (pending), `[~]` (in progress), `[x]` (complete)
- **Extension Host**: VS Code's extension execution environment
- **Kiro API**: Internal interfaces for communicating with Kiro's chat and task systems
- **Autonomous Mode**: Fully automated execution without user intervention
- **Progress Panel**: VS Code panel showing real-time automation progress
- **Control Interface**: UI elements for starting, stopping, and configuring automation
