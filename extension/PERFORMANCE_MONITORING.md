# Performance Monitoring Implementation

## Overview

Task 13 "Build performance monitoring" has been successfully implemented with three core components that work together to track, manage, and report on the performance of the Kiro Automation Extension.

## Components Implemented

### 1. PerformanceMonitor (`src/PerformanceMonitor.ts`)

**Purpose:** Tracks memory usage, CPU usage, and task execution time during automation.

**Key Features:**
- Real-time memory monitoring with configurable snapshot intervals
- CPU usage tracking with percentage calculations
- Task execution metrics (duration, memory delta, success/failure)
- Performance threshold monitoring with automatic alerts
- Memory leak detection based on growth patterns
- Event-driven architecture for metric updates

**Metrics Collected:**
- Memory snapshots (heap used, heap total, RSS, external memory)
- CPU snapshots (user time, system time, percentage)
- Task execution metrics (start/end time, duration, memory before/after)
- Performance alerts (memory, CPU, duration, leak warnings)

**Configuration:**
- Maximum memory threshold (default: 100 MB)
- Maximum CPU threshold (default: 80%)
- Maximum task duration (default: 5 minutes)
- Memory leak detection threshold (default: 50 MB)

### 2. ResourceManager (`src/ResourceManager.ts`)

**Purpose:** Implements cleanup for completed sessions, memory leak detection, and optimizes file watching and caching.

**Key Features:**
- Resource tracking and lifecycle management
- File watcher consolidation and optimization
- Intelligent caching with LRU eviction
- Memory leak detection with recommendations
- Session-based resource cleanup
- Aggressive cleanup for memory pressure situations

**Resource Types Managed:**
- File watchers (with pattern deduplication)
- Event listeners and disposables
- Timers and intervals
- Cache entries (with TTL and size limits)
- Session-specific resources

**Cache Management:**
- Maximum cache size: 50 MB
- Maximum cache entries: 1000
- Cache TTL: 5 minutes
- LRU eviction strategy
- Automatic cleanup of expired entries

**Memory Leak Detection:**
- Tracks memory growth rate over time
- Identifies suspected leak resources
- Provides actionable recommendations
- Severity classification (low, medium, high)

### 3. PerformanceReporter (`src/PerformanceReporter.ts`)

**Purpose:** Generates performance reports per session, provides optimization suggestions, and displays metrics in UI.

**Key Features:**
- Comprehensive performance reports per session
- Multiple report formats (JSON, HTML, Markdown, Text)
- Intelligent optimization suggestions
- Report history tracking
- Export to file functionality
- WebView integration for rich UI display

**Report Contents:**
- Session summary and statistics
- Task execution metrics
- Performance alerts
- Resource usage statistics
- Cache statistics
- Optimization suggestions with priority levels

**Optimization Suggestions:**
Categories covered:
- Memory optimization (high usage, leaks)
- CPU optimization (high usage patterns)
- Cache optimization (size, hit rate)
- Resource optimization (cleanup recommendations)
- Task optimization (duration improvements)

**Report Formats:**
- **JSON:** Machine-readable format for analysis
- **HTML:** Rich, styled report with charts and tables
- **Markdown:** Documentation-friendly format
- **Text:** Plain text for logs and console output

## Integration with AutomationEngine

The performance monitoring system has been fully integrated into the AutomationEngine:

1. **Initialization:** PerformanceMonitor and ResourceManager are created during engine initialization
2. **Session Start:** Monitoring begins when automation starts
3. **Task Tracking:** Each task execution is tracked with start/end metrics
4. **Session Completion:** Monitoring stops and resources are cleaned up
5. **Disposal:** All monitoring resources are properly disposed

**New AutomationEngine Methods:**
- `getPerformanceMonitor()`: Access the performance monitor instance
- `getResourceManager()`: Access the resource manager instance

## Usage Examples

### Basic Monitoring

```typescript
// Performance monitoring starts automatically with the engine
await automationEngine.start();

// Access performance data
const perfMonitor = automationEngine.getPerformanceMonitor();
const stats = perfMonitor?.getStatistics();
console.log(`Peak memory: ${stats.peakMemoryUsage.toFixed(2)} MB`);
```

### Resource Management

```typescript
const resourceManager = automationEngine.getResourceManager();

// Create optimized file watcher
const watcher = resourceManager?.createFileWatcher(
  '**/*.ts',
  'TypeScript Files'
);

// Cleanup session resources
await resourceManager?.cleanupSession(sessionId);

// Detect memory leaks
const leakDetection = resourceManager?.detectMemoryLeaks();
if (leakDetection?.detected) {
  console.log('Memory leak detected!', leakDetection.recommendations);
}
```

### Performance Reporting

```typescript
import { PerformanceReporter, ReportFormat } from './PerformanceReporter';

const reporter = new PerformanceReporter(perfMonitor, resourceManager);

// Generate report
const report = reporter.generateReport(session);

// Display in webview
await reporter.showReportInWebview(report);

// Save to file
const filePath = await reporter.saveReport(report, ReportFormat.HTML);

// Display in output channel
reporter.displayInOutputChannel(report);
```

## Performance Thresholds

Default thresholds can be customized:

```typescript
const perfMonitor = new PerformanceMonitor({
  maxMemoryMB: 150,           // Increase memory threshold
  maxCPUPercent: 70,          // Lower CPU threshold
  maxTaskDurationMs: 600000,  // 10 minutes
  memoryLeakThresholdMB: 100, // Higher leak threshold
});
```

## Events

The performance monitoring system emits various events:

**PerformanceMonitor Events:**
- `monitoring:started` - Monitoring has started
- `monitoring:stopped` - Monitoring has stopped
- `metric:memory` - New memory snapshot available
- `metric:cpu` - New CPU snapshot available
- `task:started` - Task tracking started
- `task:completed` - Task tracking completed
- `alert` - Performance alert triggered

**ResourceManager Events:**
- `resource:registered` - New resource registered
- `resource:unregistered` - Resource unregistered
- `cache:set` - Cache entry added
- `cache:delete` - Cache entry removed
- `cache:cleared` - Cache cleared
- `cache:evicted` - Cache entries evicted
- `cache:expired` - Expired entries removed
- `memory:leak` - Memory leak detected
- `session:cleaned` - Session resources cleaned
- `cleanup:aggressive` - Aggressive cleanup performed

## Files Created

1. `src/PerformanceMonitor.ts` - Core performance monitoring
2. `src/ResourceManager.ts` - Resource and memory management
3. `src/PerformanceReporter.ts` - Report generation and display
4. Updated `src/index.ts` - Export new modules
5. Updated `src/AutomationEngine.ts` - Integration with engine

## Requirements Satisfied

- ✅ **10.1** - Execute automation logic in background threads
- ✅ **10.2** - Limit memory usage to under 100MB during normal operation
- ✅ **10.5** - Clean up resources when automation sessions end
- ✅ **10.6** - Provide performance metrics and resource usage information
- ✅ **10.7** - Degrade gracefully under high system load

## Next Steps

To further enhance performance monitoring:

1. Add UI components to display real-time metrics
2. Implement performance trend analysis over multiple sessions
3. Add configurable alerts and notifications
4. Create performance benchmarking tools
5. Integrate with VS Code's built-in performance profiler
