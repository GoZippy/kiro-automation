# Kiro Task Automation Guide

## The Problem

Kiro doesn't have a public API or CLI that we can call programmatically. The automation system we built tries to call a non-existent API, which is why it gets stuck.

## The Solution

**Use the chat you're already in!** Since you're talking to Kiro right now, we can use simple commands to continue through tasks.

## Three Approaches (Easiest to Most Complex)

### Approach 1: Manual with Helper Script ‚≠ê RECOMMENDED

**How it works:** Run a script that tells you what to ask Kiro next.

**Usage:**
```bash
cd .kiro/automation
node simple-executor.js
```

This will output a prompt you can copy/paste into this chat. After Kiro completes it, run the script again for the next task.

**Pros:**
- Works immediately
- No setup needed
- You control the pace
- Can review each task

**Cons:**
- Requires copy/paste between terminal and chat
- Not fully automated

### Approach 2: Use Kiro Hooks üéØ SEMI-AUTOMATED

**How it works:** Create a Kiro hook that you can trigger with a button click.

**Setup:**
1. Open Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P)
2. Search for "Open Kiro Hook UI"
3. Create a new hook with this prompt:

```
Find the next incomplete task in .kiro/specs/*/tasks.md (look for - [ ] pattern).
Read the requirements and design docs for context.
Implement the task completely with all subtasks.
Mark it complete by changing [ ] to [x].
Then ask if I want to continue to the next task.
```

4. Set trigger to "Manual"
5. Click the hook button whenever you want to continue

**Pros:**
- One-click to continue
- Built into Kiro
- Can pause/resume easily

**Cons:**
- Still requires clicking
- Need to set up the hook first

---

### Approach 3: Build a VS Code Extension üöÄ FULLY AUTOMATED

**How it works:** Create a VS Code extension that interacts with Kiro's chat programmatically.

**What we'd need to build:**
1. VS Code extension (`.vsix` file)
2. Extension communicates with Kiro's internal APIs
3. Reads task lists
4. Sends prompts to Kiro chat
5. Monitors for completion
6. Continues to next task

**Implementation:**
```
kiro-automation-extension/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ extension.js
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ taskReader.js
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ kiroInterface.js
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ automation.js
```

**Pros:**
- Fully automated
- Can run overnight
- Professional solution
- Reusable for other projects

**Cons:**
- Takes time to build (4-8 hours)
- Need to reverse-engineer Kiro's internal APIs
- More complex to maintain
- Might break with Kiro updates

## Recommended Workflow for NOW

**Use Approach 1 (Simple Script) to keep moving:**

1. Open two windows:
   - Terminal: `cd .kiro/automation && node simple-executor.js`
   - This Kiro chat

2. Copy the prompt from terminal

3. Paste into this chat

4. Let me (Kiro) complete the task

5. Run the script again for next task

6. Repeat until done

**This gets you moving immediately while we can build Approach 3 in parallel.**

## Building the VS Code Extension (Future)

If you want full automation, here's the plan:

### Phase 1: Research (1-2 hours)
- Examine Kiro's VS Code extension structure
- Find internal APIs for chat interaction
- Identify how to send messages programmatically

### Phase 2: Build Extension (2-4 hours)
- Create extension scaffold
- Implement task reading
- Implement chat interface
- Add automation logic

### Phase 3: Test & Polish (1-2 hours)
- Test with real tasks
- Handle edge cases
- Add error recovery

### Phase 4: Package & Install
- Build `.vsix` file
- Install in VS Code
- Configure automation settings

## Quick Start RIGHT NOW

Run this in your terminal:

```bash
cd K:\Projects\ZippyGameAdmin\.kiro\automation
node simple-executor.js
```

Then copy the output and paste it into this chat. I'll execute the task, and you can run the script again for the next one.

**This is the fastest way to keep making progress!** üöÄ

## Future Enhancement Ideas

Once we have the extension:
- Auto-commit after each task
- Run tests automatically
- Deploy to staging
- Send notifications
- Generate progress reports
- Estimate time remaining
- Parallel task execution
- Smart error recovery

## Questions?

- **Q: Can we make Approach 1 even simpler?**
  - A: Yes! I can just ask you "Ready for next task?" and find it myself.

- **Q: How long to build the extension?**
  - A: 4-8 hours for a working version, more for polish.

- **Q: Will the extension work with future Kiro versions?**
  - A: Depends on how much Kiro's internals change. We'd need to maintain it.

- **Q: Can we use the extension for other projects?**
  - A: Yes! Once built, it works with any spec-based project.

## The EASIEST Solution of All

**Just ask me to continue!**

After I complete each task, simply say:
- "Next task"
- "Continue"
- "Keep going"

I'll automatically:
1. Find the next incomplete task
2. Read the context
3. Implement it
4. Mark it complete
5. Ask if you want to continue

**No scripts, no extensions, just conversation!** üí¨

This is actually the most Kiro-native way to work.
